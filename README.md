#ALGEBRA!
ALGEBRA! is an education portal for students and math-enthusiasts studying algebra. The mission of the application is to improve math comprehension by making algebra more interactive. There are currently three modules: the Equation Solver, the Expression Simplifier, and the SAT Randomizer. All can be accessed without logging in, but a logged-in user will have her/his scored tracked in the back-end database.

ALGEBRA! is a single-page full-stack (MEAN) application built as a final project in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course.

**Equation Solver** - The Equation Solver does not solve equations for users, but allows them to manipulate equations to solve them themselves. Users can input a single-variable equation and the program will convert it to a computer-readable data-structure. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide sides of the equation with the end goal of isolating the variable. If the user makes a mistake, the program will still operate on the equation so that the user can see how the mistake altered the equation, and then try to solve it from there.

**Expression Simplifier** - The expression simplifier allows users to input any polynomial. The user can then combine like terms to simplify it to its fullest extent. If two terms have the same variable taken to the same power, the program will allow a user to combine them. Otherwise, an alert will pop up.
